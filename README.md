# Assignment6

This is a program to show the efficienty of the sorting algorithms Mergesort, Quicksort, Selectionsort, InsertionSort, and Bubblesort.

To use the program, compile it with makefile.

When you run the program you can enter a file name into the command prompt and it will use that file. 

If you do not enter a file turn the command prompt the program will prompt you for a file once it runs. 

If you do not have a file you can enter the word "random" and 100,000 random decimal numbers between 1 and 1000 will be generated and you can test the algorithms with that. 

If you change your mind just enter q to quit the program.

The times and names of each algorithm will be presented as the program goes.
